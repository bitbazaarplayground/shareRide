        <h2>Canceling a Ride</h2>
        <p>
          If you need to cancel your spot in a shared ride, the person who
          created the ride will be notified with this message:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <strong>[Your Name]</strong> wants to cancel their ride. If you
          accept, they will no longer split the fare with you. Would you like
          to:
          <ul>
            <li>A) Accept</li>
            <li>B) Only accept if another user takes their place</li>
            <li>C) Cancel this cancellation request</li>
          </ul>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Accepted (Option A):</strong> You will receive a full
            refund, minus any cancellation fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accepted with Replacement (Option B):</strong> You'll be
            refunded only if another user joins and takes your place. A
            cancellation fee may still apply depending on timing or account
            history.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Request Canceled (Option C or Replacement Fails):</strong>{" "}
            You remain part of the ride and are not eligible for a refund.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cancellation Fees</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on the time before departure and previous cancellations, a
          small cancellation fee may apply. This will be shown before confirming
          your request.
        </p>

        <h2>After Booking with a Ride Provider</h2>
        <p>
          If the ride has already been booked with a third-party provider (e.g.,
          Uber or Bolt), refunds must be handled directly with them via their
          app.
