      <h2>When can I leave a rating?</h2>
      <p>
        You can leave a rating and optional comment for each passenger or driver
        once the ride has been completed. This helps maintain a respectful and
        safe experience for everyone on ShareRide.
      </p>

        </li>
        <li>Find the ride you completed.</li>
        <li>
          If the ride is eligible for feedback, you'll see a{" "}
          <strong>"Leave a Rating"</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select a star rating (1 to 5), and optionally write a short comment
          about your experience.
        </li>
        <li>
